# EXPERIMENT – 2
# Aim: To study and implement the basic structure of a C++ program with different data types.

## Apparatus: Programiz online compiler or VS Code (any C++ IDE works fine)

## Theory:
In this experiment, we explored the use of common built-in data types in C++—namely int, float, double, char, string, and bool. The idea was to take user input for each type, print the entered value, and also display how much memory each type occupies using the sizeof() function.
Here’s a quick rundown of each type we used:

### int: 
    Used to store whole numbers (like 10 or -4). Typically takes up 4 bytes.
### float:
    For decimal numbers with single precision. Also takes about 4 bytes.
### double:
    Similar to float but stores with higher precision. Uses 8 bytes.
### char:
    Stores a single character like 'A' or 'z'. Just 1 byte.
### string:
    Holds a sequence of characters which is basically text. Its size varies based on the content.
### bool:
    Represents logical values, true or false (or 1 and 0). Usually takes 1 byte.

## Conclusion:
So, through this experiment, we got a clear idea of the basic data types used in C++ and how much space they take up in memory. It’s a good foundational step for understanding how data is stored and processed in a program.
